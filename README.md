# Keylogg
# Dhanush's Python Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here you'll find a collection of Python projects and scripts that I've been working on. Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the projects.

## Keyloggers

### Overview
This repository contains a Python script for a basic keylogger. A keylogger is a program that records every keystroke made on a computer. **Use this responsibly and for educational purposes only.**

### How It Works
The keylogger script captures the keystrokes and saves them into a log file. The script is designed to run in the background without alerting the user.

### Installation
To use the keylogger, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhanush29092004/dhanush
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
   
    ```bash
    cd dhanush
3.**Install the required Python packages**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.**Run the keylogger script**
   ```bash
   python keyloggers.py
```
**Disclaimer**

This script is intended for educational purposes only. Do not use it for malicious activities or to violate privacy laws.
